# PhysicalDesign28nm
Physical Design implementation means the layout assembling and connectivity of digital logic gates as per the design input file (called as netlist) of an Integrated chip say a processor, by meeting the design specifications like timing, power and area. Here in this design we have used the inputs given by the synthesis team and further physical design flow has been carried out in a proper physical design flow i.e. from import design, floor plan further placement till signoff using the Physical design tools. At each stage checks are done such as timing (hold &amp; setup), quality of report, congestion, routing etc.
